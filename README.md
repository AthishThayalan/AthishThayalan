Athish Thayalan

I am a first-class graduate from the University of Nottingham with a strong background in Mathematics and Economics. Passionate about leveraging analytical skills in technology and coding to contribute to the technological revolution. Excel in team-based activities, with a focus on interpersonal skills and relationship-building. Highly coachable and eager to pursue a challenging career that enhances problem-solving abilities. When I'm not coding you'll find me at the gym 🏋🏿 or enjoying a cup of coffee ☕.
